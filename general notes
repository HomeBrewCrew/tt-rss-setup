General Notes about setting up tt-rss in AWS
* Launch the VPC
* Launch and configure Ubuntu E2C/VPC (Security groups and elastic IPs)
* Verify you can SSH into into it 
    * ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem ubuntu@ipAddress
* Create a new admin user for setting up and running ttrss 
* Install PHP and it's modules
    * sudo apt-get install php
        * At the time of this writting it was PHP 7
* Install the needed modules
    * sudo apt-get install php-json php-xml php-mbstring php-fileinfo php-curl php-gd php-pgsql
* Install PostgreSQL
    * sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
* Installing PostgreSQL automattically created a Ubuntu user named postgres
    * Disable password loging for this user
    * Set up the user for SSH
    * Use this user for managing the PostgreSQL DB 
    * https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/First_steps 
    * Create a new user and database for use by the ttrss application(one with minimal permissions and only on the necessary resources)
* Instal and configure Nginx 
    * If you are running into issues there is a command to test your Nginx configs
        * sudo nginx -t

TODO
* Disable password SSH login for ALL users(I think I got them all but see if you can do it at a system level rather than for each user)
* How to login from GUI locally using ssh
* Evidently schema does not mean database in PostgreSQL, figure out this difference and general PostgreSQL stuff
* Turn this into pretty .md
